  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>An empanada is a type of baked or fried turnover consisting of pastry and filling, common in Spanish, other
    Southern European, Latin American, and Iberian-influenced cultures around the world.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 medium potatoes</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    <li>2 onion, chopped</li>
    <li>3 green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>¾ cup green olives, pitted and chopped</li>
    <li>2 hard-cooked eggs</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>24 empanada pastry rounds</li>
    <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
      barely tender, about 8 minutes. Drain. Once cool enough to handle, peel and cut into cubes. Set aside. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a large skillet and cook onion and green onions until softened, about 5 minutes. Add
      bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes. Add ground beef; cook and stir until beef is browned, about 5 minutes. Season
      with paprika, cayenne pepper, and salt. </li>
    <li>Remove beef mixture from heat; add potatoes and olives. Stir in chopped hard-cooked eggs; set filling aside to
      cool, about 20 minutes. </li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line 2 baking sheets with aluminum foil and lightly grease
      with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Place an empanada pastry round on a flat surface and lightly wet the edges with warm water. Put a large
      tablespoon of cooled filling in the center and fold dough over. Seal edges by pressing with a fork. Repeat with
      remaining rounds and filling. Transfer empanadas to the prepared baking sheets and brush with beaten egg. </li>
    <li> Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
  </ol>
